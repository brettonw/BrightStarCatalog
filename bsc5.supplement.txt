Note on SpType: If the complete modern (MK) classification is too long for the data field, it is
                given in the remarks file and an asterisk (*) occurs in this data field. Mt. Wilson
                luminosity classes are given as lower case letters in bytes 128-129. The "W" in
                Wolf-Rayet types is in byte 129 with the C or N in the following byte (130). In
                general, the temperature class (O, B, A, ..., S, C) occurs in byte 130 and the
                temperature subclass in byte 131 (intermediate sub-classes extend to 132-133 and
                other characters can be in bytes 131, ...). Characters normally appearing as lower
                case in standard notation, e.g. p, e, Si, Mn, Hg, Iab, are coded in lower case. A
                greek delta appearing for HD 189337 is coded as "@d".
